### Create conda env to reproduce examples

- My condaenv was named _ieee_. Change it as you prefer.

```
conda env create --file environment.yml
```

### Detailed Adaline Learning Process

Using Delta Rule for updating weights on a very simple scenario where error surface is parabolic and can be visualized in three dimensions.

### Linear Combination of Non-Linear Function

Using Adaline weights to approximate the coefficients of a linear combination of non-linear functions.
